# Browser Based Runtime Classifier Using Transfer Learning

1. Collecting between 50 to 100 images from webcam for each hand gesture should be good enough for most models. However, feel free to experiment and try to train your model with less or more images. 
2. Wait until Training has Finished before you Download the Model. To make sure training has completed, open the Developer Tools and look at the Console output. When the browser alerts that "Training is Done!" click Ok. After you click Ok, you will see the value of the LOSS being printed in Console. Once the LOSS values stop being printed, you can go ahead and click the "Download Model" button to download the model and its weights.
